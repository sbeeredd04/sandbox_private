        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### ✅ Why This Is a Good Sign\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Evidence of Convergence:**  \n",
        "   The rapid decline in policy changes suggests the Q-values have stabilized.  \n",
        "   Once updates stop altering the “best action” per state, it means the agent has found a consistent way to maximize reward.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Improved Predictability:**  \n",
        "   Policy stability reflects reliable behavior — the agent no longer oscillates between different strategies, which means it can be trusted to make the same decisions under similar conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Efficient Learning:**  \n",
        "   The fact that stability occurs early (around episode 100) indicates that the agent learned efficiently.  \n",
        "   It explored enough to discover good policies, then exploited them effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Temporal-Difference Convergence:**  \n",
        "   The flattening curve means the temporal difference error (δ) has minimized — updates are small, and predictions match outcomes.  \n",
        "   This is precisely what TD learning aims for.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### ⚠️ When It Might Be a Bad Sign\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Premature Convergence:**  \n",
        "   If exploration (ε) decays too quickly, the agent might “lock in” a suboptimal policy.  \n",
        "   Policy stability would appear early — but for the *wrong* reason. The flat line would represent stagnation, not mastery.  \n",
        "   - **Check:** Compare this with your reward curve.  \n",
        "     If rewards are low but policy is stable → the agent has converged too soon.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Lack of Continued Exploration:**  \n",
        "   In environments with delayed or hidden rewards, ongoing exploration is essential.  \n",
        "   Too-stable a policy can prevent discovery of better long-term strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Overfitting to Environment Layout:**  \n",
        "   If the environment is small and deterministic (like a 5×5 grid), the policy will stabilize very fast.  \n",
        "   That’s fine here — but in richer environments, you’d want slower stabilization to ensure generalization.\n",

        "The cumulative reward curve shows a slower initial climb compared to the 3-obstacle baseline, with more pronounced negative spikes during early episodes. Episode lengths take approximately 20 to 30 additional episodes to stabilize below 25 steps, indicating delayed convergence. The exploration rate remains consistent around the epsilon value of 0.2, but the agent requires more exploratory actions to discover viable paths through the denser obstacle field. Policy changes exhibit extended volatility through episode 150, suggesting the agent continues refining its strategy longer than in simpler environments.\n"

        "This experiment demonstrates how environmental complexity directly impacts the state space exploration requirements in Q-learning. With 6 obstacles occupying 24% of the grid, the agent faces a more constrained action space where many state-action pairs lead to penalties, forcing more thorough exploration before value estimates stabilize. The extended convergence time reflects the fundamental RL trade-off between exploration breadth and policy refinement. Increased negative rewards create sharper Q-value gradients, which can improve long-term policy quality but require more episodes for the temporal difference updates to propagate accurate value information throughout the table.\n"

        "Adding more obstacles forces the agent to explore a narrower set of viable paths, which delays convergence because the Q-learning algorithm must sample more state-action pairs to distinguish safe routes from penalty zones. The slower reward improvement reflects the increased difficulty of credit assignment: positive rewards from reaching the goal must propagate backward through longer chains of states while competing with more frequent negative signals from obstacles. Despite the added complexity, the agent still converges to an optimal policy, demonstrating Q-learning's robustness in handling sparse reward environments with dense penalty structures.\n"

        "\n",
        "The agent's final path becomes more indirect and requires additional maneuvering around the increased number of blocked cells. Instead of a relatively straight diagonal route from start to goal, the learned policy shows more lateral movements and detours to avoid the six obstacle locations. The path exhibits more directional changes, with the agent often moving along the grid edges or taking zigzag routes to circumvent clusters of obstacles. This results in a longer optimal path length compared to the 3-obstacle environment, even after the policy has fully converged. The increased path complexity is reflected in both the episode length metrics and the final policy visualization, where arrows show more varied directions rather than consistent right and down movements.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Question 2: Does it take longer for the agent to learn the optimal path in a more challenging grid?\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, convergence is noticeably slower with six obstacles compared to the baseline three-obstacle environment. The episode length stabilization occurs approximately 20 to 30 episodes later, and the policy changes continue for roughly 50 additional episodes before reaching stability. This extended learning period occurs because the agent must explore more state-action combinations to identify which paths avoid penalties while still reaching the goal efficiently. The denser obstacle field creates more local minima in the value function, requiring additional exploration to discover the globally optimal route. Additionally, the credit assignment problem becomes more complex as positive rewards must propagate through longer state sequences while competing with more frequent obstacle penalties.\n"
