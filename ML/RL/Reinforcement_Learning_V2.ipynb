        "\n",
        "#### ✅ Why This Is a Good Sign\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Evidence of Convergence:**  \n",
        "   The rapid decline in policy changes suggests the Q-values have stabilized.  \n",
        "   Once updates stop altering the “best action” per state, it means the agent has found a consistent way to maximize reward.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Improved Predictability:**  \n",
        "   Policy stability reflects reliable behavior — the agent no longer oscillates between different strategies, which means it can be trusted to make the same decisions under similar conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Efficient Learning:**  \n",
        "   The fact that stability occurs early (around episode 100) indicates that the agent learned efficiently.  \n",
        "   It explored enough to discover good policies, then exploited them effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Temporal-Difference Convergence:**  \n",
        "   The flattening curve means the temporal difference error (δ) has minimized — updates are small, and predictions match outcomes.  \n",
        "   This is precisely what TD learning aims for.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### ⚠️ When It Might Be a Bad Sign\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Premature Convergence:**  \n",
        "   If exploration (ε) decays too quickly, the agent might “lock in” a suboptimal policy.  \n",
        "   Policy stability would appear early — but for the *wrong* reason. The flat line would represent stagnation, not mastery.  \n",
        "   - **Check:** Compare this with your reward curve.  \n",
        "     If rewards are low but policy is stable → the agent has converged too soon.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Lack of Continued Exploration:**  \n",

        "\n",
        "**Cumulative Reward Trend:**  \n",
        "The reward curve shows significantly more volatility in the early episodes (0–100) compared to the baseline experiment. Initial rewards dropped deeper into negative territory—often reaching below -50—as the agent frequently collided with the increased number of obstacles. The recovery phase (episodes 100–300) is more gradual and uneven, with oscillations indicating the agent struggled to find consistent safe paths. By episode 300–500, rewards stabilize closer to zero but remain slightly more negative on average than in the 3-obstacle baseline, suggesting that even the learned policy incurs more step penalties navigating the denser obstacle field.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Episode Length Pattern:**  \n",
        "Steps per episode remained elevated for a longer period. Where the baseline converged around episode 60, this experiment showed prolonged high step counts (100+ steps) extending past episode 100. The decline was less steep, reflecting the increased complexity of finding efficient routes. Even after convergence (around episode 200), episode lengths settled at a higher average (15–25 steps) compared to the baseline (10–20 steps), indicating the optimal path itself is longer due to necessary detours around additional obstacles.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Exploration Rate Behavior:**  \n",
        "The exploration rate pattern maintained the same stochastic fluctuation as the baseline (due to fixed epsilon = 0.2), but the impact of each exploratory action became more consequential. Random moves had a higher probability of hitting obstacles, making exploration episodes more costly. This is evident in the correlation between exploration spikes and reward drops throughout training.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Smoothed Reward Trend:**  \n",
        "The 20-episode moving average reveals a slower, more gradual improvement curve compared to baseline. The agent required approximately 250–300 episodes to reach reward stability, versus ~150 in the baseline. The final plateau is lower (around -15 to -10) versus baseline's near-zero convergence, confirming that navigating six obstacles inherently accumulates more penalties even with an optimal policy.\n"

        "\n",
        "**State-Space Complexity and Q-Value Convergence:**  \n",
        "Adding three more obstacles dramatically increased the effective complexity of the state-action space. While the grid size remained 5×5 (25 states), the number of *viable* paths decreased significantly. More obstacles create more \"dead-end\" regions where many actions lead to penalties, forcing the Q-learning algorithm to explore a larger portion of the action space before discovering rewarding trajectories. This explains the delayed convergence—temporal-difference updates must propagate through more circuitous routes, and early Q-value estimates contain more noise due to frequent penalty encounters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Exploration-Exploitation Trade-off Under Constraints:**  \n",
        "With obstacles occupying 6 of 25 cells (24% of the grid), the cost of exploration increased substantially. Each random action (from epsilon-greedy) had a nearly 1-in-4 chance of hitting an obstacle and receiving -10 reward, compared to 1-in-8 in the baseline. This amplified the exploration penalty, making early learning slower and more volatile. The fixed exploration rate (ε = 0.2) that worked efficiently in the baseline became suboptimal here—too much exploration prolonged convergence, but too little might have trapped the agent in local optima. This demonstrates how **environment density should inform hyperparameter tuning**, particularly exploration schedules.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reward Shaping and Path Optimality:**  \n",
        "The final policy shows longer episode lengths and lower cumulative rewards despite successful learning. This reflects an important RL principle: the \"optimal\" policy is optimal *relative to the reward structure*, not necessarily the shortest path. The agent learned to avoid obstacles (primary objective) while reaching the goal (secondary objective), but the dense obstacle placement forced longer detours. The persistent negative step rewards (-1 per move) accumulated more heavily, illustrating how **environmental constraints can create irreducible costs** even in a converged policy. This outcome highlights the distinction between *learning success* (convergence) and *task efficiency* (performance ceiling).\n"

        "**Connecting Results to Learning Theory:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The increased obstacle density fundamentally altered the agent's learning dynamics by introducing a **sparse reward landscape**. In the baseline, the agent could discover goal-reaching paths relatively quickly through random exploration. With six obstacles, successful trajectories became rarer, meaning the +10 goal reward was encountered less frequently in early episodes. This delays the **credit assignment** process—Q-learning relies on bootstrapping, where positive values propagate backward from the goal state through temporal-difference updates. With fewer successful episodes initially, these positive signals took longer to diffuse through the Q-table, extending the time to convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "The persistence of higher episode lengths even after policy stabilization reveals an important concept: **suboptimality bounds under constraints**. The agent learned an obstacle-avoiding policy that successfully reaches the goal, but the physical layout of obstacles creates unavoidable detours. This demonstrates that RL agents optimize within the structure of the environment—they find the best *feasible* solution, not necessarily an idealized shortest path. The slightly negative final rewards reflect this constrained optimality: the learned policy is optimal given the obstacle configuration, even though it accumulates more step penalties than the baseline.\n",
        "\n",
        "This experiment underscores a key RL trade-off: **environmental complexity increases sample complexity**. More obstacles meant the agent needed more episodes (and more total steps) to learn an effective policy. In real-world applications, this has critical implications—complex environments may require exponentially more training data, longer convergence times, or adaptive exploration strategies. The fixed epsilon that worked efficiently in the baseline became less appropriate here, suggesting that **dynamic exploration decay** or **curiosity-driven exploration** mechanisms might accelerate learning in dense obstacle scenarios. Ultimately, this experiment shows that while Q-learning is robust enough to handle increased challenge, the learning efficiency degrades predictably as the environment becomes more constrained.\n"

        "### Key Takeaways from Experiment 5\n",
        "\n",
        "**How the Agent's Path Changed:**\n",
        "The agent's final policy in Experiment 5 reveals more complex navigation patterns with longer detour routes. While the baseline (3 obstacles) allowed relatively direct diagonal movement from start to goal, the 6-obstacle configuration forced the agent to learn multi-stage routing—moving around clusters of obstacles rather than through open corridors. The learned policy shows more zigzag patterns and intermediate waypoints, demonstrating the agent's ability to chain together safe moves even when direct paths are blocked.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Learning Time in More Challenging Grids:**\n",
        "Yes, it took significantly longer for the agent to learn the optimal path. Convergence time approximately **tripled** (from ~60 episodes to ~200 episodes). This delay stems from two factors: (1) **reduced reward signal frequency**—with more obstacles blocking paths, the agent reached the goal less often during early exploration, slowing the propagation of positive Q-values backward through the state space; and (2) **increased penalty noise**—early random exploration hit obstacles more frequently, creating volatile Q-value updates that required more episodes to stabilize. The learning curve's steeper slope in the baseline versus the gradual climb in Experiment 5 visually confirms this fundamental principle: **environmental complexity directly increases sample complexity** in reinforcement learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Practical Implications:**\n",
        "This experiment demonstrates that obstacle density acts as a natural difficulty scaling mechanism in RL environments. For real-world applications—robot navigation in crowded spaces, game AI in complex maps, or route planning in congested networks—practitioners should expect training time and data requirements to scale non-linearly with environmental constraints. The persistent lower final rewards in Experiment 5, despite successful convergence, also highlight an important design consideration: **reward shaping matters**. In dense environments, pure step penalties may need adjustment (e.g., smaller magnitude) or the goal reward may need increase to maintain learning motivation and policy quality.\n"
